## Development Notes

### Current State:
- Development server: `yarn dev` → http://localhost:5173
- Repository: https://github.com/Mundisoft/idle-rpg
- Main branch: `master`

### Key Files:
- `/src/index.css` - Custom styling and game CSS classes
- `/tailwind.config.js` - Tailwind configuration with game colors
- `/postcss.config.js` - PostCSS configuration
- `/package.json` - Dependencies and scripts

### Development Commands:
```bash
yarn dev          # Start development server
yarn build        # Build for production
yarn preview      # Preview production build
yarn lint         # Run ESLint
```

### Troubleshooting:
- If Tailwind classes don't work, verify PostCSS configuration
- For git issues, ensure you're on the master branch
- Development server should auto-reload on file changes
